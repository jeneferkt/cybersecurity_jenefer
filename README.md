The primary goal of a keylogger in cybersecurity attacks is to compromise the security and privacy of individuals or organizations by secretly capturing sensitive information entered via keyboards. This poses significant risks to personal privacy, financial security, and data integrity.
The problem is compounded by the fact that keyloggers can operate stealthily, often evading detection by traditional antivirus software and other security measures. Additionally, keyloggers can be deployed through various vectors including phishing emails, malicious websites, compromised software downloads, and physical access to devices.
